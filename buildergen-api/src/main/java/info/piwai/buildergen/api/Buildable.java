/**
 * Use on any class to generate its builder. The builder will be located in the
 * same package, and will have the same name with an additional suffix. The
 * default suffix is "Builder". Therefore, a MyBean class annotated with
 * {@link Buildable} will generate a MyBeanBuilder class. The suffix can easily
 * be changed by specifying a different value to the @Builder annotation. For
 * instance :
 * 
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * @Builder("Factory")
 * public class MyBean {
 * 
 * }</code>
 * </pre>
 * 
 * will generate a MyBeanFactory class.<br />
 * <br />
 * Generated Builder has default 'create' factory method which can be changed by
 * specifying a different value using 'factoryMethod' attribute. For instance:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     <code>
 *      @Builder(value = "Factory", factoryMethod="custom")
 *      public class MyBean {
 *      }
 *     </code>
 * </pre>
 * will generate a factory method named <code>custom()</code>
 * <br />
 * The {@link Buildable} annotated element should be a class. It cannot be an
 * enum, nor an inner class. It should not be abstract. <br />
 * 
 * The {@link Buildable} annotated class should have at least one not private
 * constructor. <br />
 * If the {@link Buildable} annotated class have more than one not private
 * constructor, there should be one (and only one) of those constructors
 * annotated with {@link Build}.<br />
 * <br />
 * The generated builder implements the {@link Builder} interface.<br />
 * <br />
 * The generated builder has a public default constructor, and a create() static
 * factory method as well. This enables chained calls such as : MyBean myBean =
 * MyBeanBuilder.create().name("foo").build();
 *
